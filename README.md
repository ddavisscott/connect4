Started with designing the board. First, I tried to use divs and CSS. I then decided to use SVG in order to be able to animate the element in the future.
Initially I thought of generating each element manually then I decided to take advantage v-for. 
I may have use a nested v-for for each row also. But I taught it is simple enough to render them without it. It would be less code and more elegant. I would probably put this on my TODO list.

I spent some time on deciding whether I should use an 2D array or an array of objects.I decided to use the 2D array. 
If I had more time:

1) I would implement the yellow wining case (which is not really hard at this point)
2) Work more on the computer strategy
3) Work with more on the UI
4) Make it multiplayer
5) Write Unit Test


My main focus to demonstrate different kind of skills instead of making certain sections complete. 
Such as using Vuetify Library
Using Vue routines literals, conditionals etc. 
Using SVG elements. 
Simple error handling
Code style

I did not have a chance to go in to routing or add Vuex (although I did install it) simply because of the time constraint and also the app is really simple and does not need Vuex. 

Finally, I did not have time to test this throughly I apologize for any possible bug.

I spend 3 hours and really enjoyed this.
